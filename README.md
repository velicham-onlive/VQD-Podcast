# Velicham Quran Dars-Podcast conversion

What? (The Idea):
Velicham Quran Dars podcast conversion.

Why? (The step forward):
The podcasts are gaining momentum in the current world since it’s an organised way for delivering the series of audio content to the public. Recent support from multiple vendors, especially from Google, endorsed the same to gain momentum in the Eastern world.

How? (The solution):
The Google implementation guide makes the podcasts searchable globally for free in different podcast apps in Mobile and other platforms as well.

The implementation approach (proposal):
As per documentation the audio files (the podcasts) to be hosted in public available servers with certain tags and an index page to reach out by Googlebot or similar ones. The index.html points to a *.rss file where all podcasts are described with possible details, in turn, it points to an absolute path of the audio files.

Alhamdulillah, We’d a trial implementation as per the google podcast guide(refer footnote 2) and it is a success. Screenshots from iPhone & Android phones furnished below.

Going forward: The code implementation skeleton is ready and can be forked. Only tasks left would be to append audio files to respective folders with possible description. The description helps to podcast result in Google searches.
(How long shall be a description? some sample descriptions?
Which language (Malayalam/English) will give better reaching from Google Searches? )

Once the framework is done, which is already, only task pending would be to upload the audio files with the proper template. This can be done with people who have computer basics.(We can choose one Surah, for example Fatiha, and prepare ourselves. With that reference in hand, our existing Admins from different batches would be able to help us to complete the remaining)
