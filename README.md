# Velicham Quran Dars-Podcast conversion

#### What? (The Idea):
The conversion of WhatsApp-based audio classes to podcast series. The series was called **Velicham Quran Dars series** and running in multiple batches within the Malayalee Mulsim communities globally.

#### Why? (The step forward):
The Velicham series had already been grown to multiple batches and still growing, hence to cater the series with it's full potential the Team Velicham decided to introduce the same thru podcast services to benefit the communities in an organized fashion. Meanwhile, the podcasts are gaining momentum in the current world due to an organised way for delivering the series of audio content to the public. Recent support from multiple vendors, especially from Google, endorsed the same to gain momentum in the Eastern world.

#### How? (The solution):
The Google podcast [guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/podcast) made the podcasts searchable globally for the different podcast engines catering in the Mobile and other platforms.

#### The implementation approach (proposal):
As per documentation the audio files (the podcast episodes) to be hosted in public servers, we opted GitHub, with certain tags and an index page to reach out by Googlebot or similar ones. The index.html points to the feeds(\*.rss) file where all podcasts are described with possible details, in turn, it points to an absolute path of the audio files.
